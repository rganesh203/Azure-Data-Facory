1. more than 30 days old pdf files through pdf

	If you want to copy PDF files that are more than 30 days old from a source to a destination using Azure Data Factory (ADF), you can leverage the Get Metadata, Filter, ForEach, and Copy Data activities. This approach assumes your PDF files are stored in a storage account with date metadata.

	Steps:
	Get Metadata Activity for Source:

	Create a Get Metadata activity for the source storage account.
	Configure the source dataset accordingly.
	Filter Activity:

	Add a Filter activity to filter out files that are more than 30 days old.
	Use a filter expression that compares the last modified timestamp of each file with the current date.
	Example filter expression:
	json
	Copy code
	@greater(activity('Get Metadata Source').output.lastModified, addDays(utcnow(), -30))
	ForEach Activity:

	Add a ForEach activity to iterate over the filtered files.
	Configure the ForEach to loop over the output of the Filter activity.
	Copy Data Activity:

	Inside the ForEach loop, add a Copy Data activity to copy each file from the source to the destination.
	Use the item().name expression to dynamically reference the current file being processed.
	Configure the source and destination datasets for the Copy Data activity.
	Example Pipeline:
	Here's a simplified example of what the pipeline might look like in JSON format:

	json
	Copy code
	{
		"activities": [
			{
				"name": "Get Metadata Source",
				"type": "GetMetadata",
				"linkedServiceName": {
					// Linked service details for source storage account
				},
				"dataset": {
					// Source dataset details
				}
			},
			{
				"name": "Filter Old PDF Files",
				"type": "Filter",
				"dependsOn": [
					"Get Metadata Source"
				],
				"expression": {
					"value": "@greater(activity('Get Metadata Source').output.lastModified, addDays(utcnow(), -30))",

	This pipeline will copy PDF files that are more than 30 days old from the source to the destination, reducing the amount of data processed 
	during each run. Adjust the dataset, linked service, and other details based on your actual setup.
	
2. Compare and Copy Missing Files from. Source to Destination | Use of GetMeta, Filter, ForEach & Copy
	ChatGPT
	Certainly! If you want to compare and copy missing files from a source to a destination using Azure Data Factory (ADF), you can follow these steps using the Get Metadata, Filter, ForEach, and Copy Data activities. This approach assumes you are dealing with files in a storage account.

	Scenario:
	Assume you have a source and a destination Azure Storage container, and you want to compare these two locations, identifying any missing files in the destination, and copying only those missing files.

	Steps:
	Get Metadata Activity for Source and Destination:

	Create two Get Metadata activities: one for the source and one for the destination.
	Configure the source and destination datasets accordingly.
	Extract File Lists:

	Use the output of the Get Metadata activities to extract lists of files from both the source and destination.
	Access these lists from the metadata output, typically under childItems.
	Filter Activity:

	Add a Filter activity to filter out the files that are present in the source but missing in the destination.
	Use the excludeItems function to filter out items present in the destination.
	Example filter expression:
	json
	Copy code
	@not(contains(activity('Get Metadata Destination').output.childItems, item().name))
	ForEach Activity:

	Add a ForEach activity to iterate over the filtered files.
	Configure the ForEach to loop over the output of the Filter activity.
	Copy Data Activity:

	Inside the ForEach loop, add a Copy Data activity to copy each file from the source to the destination.

3. delete more than 1 mb file blob storage azure

	To delete more than 1 MB files in Azure Blob Storage using Azure Data Factory (ADF), you can use the Get Metadata, Filter, ForEach, and Delete Activity components. Here's a step-by-step guide:

	Scenario:
	Assume you have a container in Azure Blob Storage containing various files, and you want to delete files larger than 1 MB.

	Steps:
	Get Metadata Activity:

	Create a Get Metadata activity for the source blob container.
	Configure the source dataset accordingly.
	Filter Activity:

	Add a Filter activity to filter out files larger than 1 MB.
	Use the size property from the output of the Get Metadata activity to filter the files.
	Example filter expression:

	@less(activity('Get Metadata').output.size, 1048576)
	This expression checks if the size of the file is less than 1 MB (1 MB = 1048576 bytes).
	ForEach Activity:

	Add a ForEach activity to iterate over the filtered files.
	Configure the ForEach to loop over the output of the Filter activity.
	Delete Activity:

	Inside the ForEach loop, add a Delete activity to delete each file from the source.
	Use the item().name expression to dynamically reference the current file being processed.
	Configure the source dataset for the Delete activity.

				]
			}
		]
	}
	Adjust the dataset, linked service, and other details based on your actual setup. 
	This pipeline will delete files larger than 1 MB from the specified Azure Blob Storage container.

4. how to achieve files after loading through adf pipeline

	It seems like there might be some context missing in your question. However, if you are referring to taking action on files after loading them using Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline, you can use activities such as the If Condition, ForEach, and additional Copy Data activities based on your specific requirements.

	Here's a general example workflow:

	Scenario:
	Assume you have a pipeline that loads data from a source to a destination, and after loading, you want to perform additional actions on the loaded files.

	Steps:
	Load Data:

	Start with a Copy Data activity to load data from the source to the destination.
	If Condition Activity:

	Add an If Condition activity after the Copy Data activity.
	Configure the condition based on a specific criterion. For example, check if the loading was successful.
	Example condition expression:
	json
	Copy code
	@equals(activity('Copy Data').output.executionStatus, 'Succeeded')
	Actions for True or False Branch:

	Inside the If Condition activity, add activities based on whether the condition is true or false.
	For the true branch, you might add a Web or Azure Function activity to trigger external processes.
	For the false branch, you could add a notification activity or logging to handle cases where the loading was not successful.
	ForEach Activity (Optional):

	If you want to perform actions on each file individually, you can use a ForEach activity.
	Configure the ForEach activity to loop over the list of files in the destination.
	Inside the ForEach loop, add activities to process each file individually.
	Example Pipeline:
	Here's a simplified example of what the pipeline might look like in JSON format:

	json
	Copy code
	{
		"activities": [
			{
				"name": "Copy Data",
				"type": "CopyData",
				"linkedServiceName": {
					// Linked service details for source and destination
				},
				"inputs": [
					{
						"referenceName": "SourceDataset",
						"type": "DatasetReference"
					}
				],
				"outputs": [
					{
						"referenceName": "DestinationDataset",
						"type": "DatasetReference"
					}
				]
			},
			{
				"name": "If Condition",
				"type": "IfCondition",
				"dependsOn": [
					"Copy Data"
				],
				"linkedServiceName": {
					// Linked service details for condition
				},
				"expression": {
					"value": "@equals(activity('Copy Data').output.executionStatus, 'Succeeded')",
					"type": "Expression"
				},
				"ifTrueActivities": [
					{
						"name": "Web Activity (or other action)",
						"type": "Web",
						// Configure the Web activity details
					}
				],
				"ifFalseActivities": [
					{
						"name": "Notification Activity (or other action)",
						"type": "Notification",
						// Configure the Notification activity details
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}
	Adjust the dataset, linked service, and other details based on your actual setup and requirements. 
	This pipeline will execute additional actions based on the success or failure of the data loading 
	process.

          {
            "column": "ColumnToConcatenate",
            "newColumnName": "ConcatenatedColumn",
            "aggregateFunction": "STRING_AGG",
            "size": 4000,
            "scale": 0
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

							}
						]
					}
				]
			}

	}
	In this example, the pipeline iterates over each file in the folder and updates the variables with the details of the latest file based on the modified timestamp. 
	Adjust the dataset, linked service, and other details based on your actual setup.

17. copy data as per file size

	ChatGPT
	To copy data based on file size in Azure Data Factory, you can use the Get Metadata activity to retrieve information about the files in a folder, and then use the ForEach and Copy Data activities to selectively copy files based on their size.

	Here's a step-by-step guide:

	Scenario:
	Assume you have a folder in a storage account, and you want to copy files based on their size.

	Steps:
	Create a Dataset for the Folder:

	Define a dataset for the folder where you want to copy files.
	Ensure that the dataset points to the correct folder in your storage account.
	Get Metadata Activity:

	Add a Get Metadata activity to your pipeline.
	Configure the Get Metadata activity to use the dataset for the folder.
	ForEach Activity:

	Add a ForEach activity to iterate over the files obtained from the Get Metadata activity.
	Configure the ForEach to loop over the output of the Get Metadata activity.
	If Condition Activity:

	Inside the ForEach activity, add an If Condition activity to check the size of each file and decide whether to copy it or not.
	Use the @greater or @less expression to compare file sizes.
	Copy Data Activity:

	Add a Copy Data activity inside the If Condition to copy the file if the condition is met.
	Configure the source and destination datasets for the Copy Data activity.
	Example Pipeline:
	Here's a simplified example of what the pipeline might look like in JSON format:

	json
	Copy code
	{
		"activities": [
			{
				"name": "Get Metadata",
				"type": "GetMetadata",
				"linkedServiceName": {
					// Linked service details for storage account
				},
				"dataset": {
					// Dataset details for the folder
				}
			},
			{
				"name": "ForEach File",
				"type": "ForEach",
				"dependsOn": [
					"Get Metadata"
				],
				"foreach": "@activity('Get Metadata').output.childItems",
				"activities": [
					{
						"name": "If Condition",
						"type": "IfCondition",
						"expression": {
							"value": "@greater(item().size, 1048576)",  // Example: Copy if file size > 1 MB
							"type": "Expression"
						},
						"ifTrueActivities": [
							{
								"name": "Copy Large File",
								"type": "CopyData",
								"linkedServiceName": {
									// Linked service details for source and destination storage accounts
								},
								"inputs": [
									{
										"referenceName": "SourceDataset",
										"type": "DatasetReference"
									}
								],
								"outputs": [
									{
										"referenceName": "DestinationDataset",
										"type": "DatasetReference"
									}
								],
								"source": {
									"path": "@item().name"
								}
							}
						]
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}
	In this example, the pipeline iterates over each file in the folder and checks whether the file size is greater than a specified threshold (1 MB in this case). If the condition is true, the file is copied to the destination.
	Adjust the dataset, linked service, and other details based on your actual setup.

18. split single row into multiple rows adf

	json
	Copy code
	{
	  "name": "SplitRowsDataFlow",
	  "type": "MappingDataFlow",
	  "linkedServiceName": {
		// Linked service details for source and destination
	  },
	  "sources": [
		{
		  "name": "Source",
		  "output": {
			"name": "SourceOutput"
		  }
		}
	  ],
	  "sinks": [
		{
		  "name": "Sink",
		  "input": {
			"name": "SinkInput"
		  }
		}
	  ],
	  "transformations": [
		{
		  "name": "SplitRows",
		  "description": "",
		  "linkedServiceName": {
			// Linked service details for derived column transformation
		  },
		  "referenceLink": {
			// Reference link for transformation details
		  },
		  "type": "DerivedColumn",
		  "schema": [
			{
			  "name": "DelimitedColumn",

				"name": "SplitColumn",
				"expression": "split(column('DelimitedColumn'), ',')",
				"type": "String"
			  }
			]
		  }
		}
	  ]
	}
	In this example, the SplitColumn is created by splitting the DelimitedColumn using the split function. 
	Adjust the dataset, linked service, and other details based on your actual setup.

	Adjust the dataset, linked service, and other details based on your actual setup. If you need to 
	perform additional data transformations, you might consider using a Mapping Data Flow within the pipeline.

21. how to use wildcard characters in get metadata activity

	As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Azure Data Factory (ADF) Get Metadata activity does not directly support wildcard characters for filtering objects (files, folders, etc.) in the source. The Get Metadata activity is primarily used to retrieve information about objects in a specified folder or path.

	However, you can achieve similar functionality by using a combination of activities and dynamic expressions in ADF. Here's an example workflow to simulate wildcard filtering:

	Scenario:
	Assume you want to get metadata for files in a folder that match a certain pattern using a wildcard character.

	Steps:
	Get a List of Files:

	Use a Get Metadata activity to get the metadata for all files in the folder without applying a wildcard filter.
	Filter the Metadata:

	Use a Filter activity to filter the metadata based on your wildcard pattern. This is achieved using dynamic expressions.
	Process Filtered Files:

	Iterate over the filtered list of files using a ForEach activity.
	Perform further processing or copy operations on each filtered file.
	Example Pipeline (JSON):
	Here's a simplified example of what the pipeline might look like in JSON format:

	{
	  "name": "FilterFilesPipeline",
	  "activities": [
		{
		  "name": "GetAllFilesMetadata",
		  "type": "GetMetadata",
		  "linkedServiceName": {
			// Linked service details for your storage account
		  },
		  "dataset": {
			// Dataset details for your source folder
		  }
		},
		{
		  "name": "FilterFiles",
		  "type": "Filter",
		  "dependsOn": [
			"GetAllFilesMetadata"
		  ],
		  "linkedServiceName": {
			// Linked service details for your storage account
		  },
		  "typeProperties": {
			"items": {
			  "value": "@activity('GetAllFilesMetadata').output.childItems",
			  "type": "Expression"
			},
			"condition": {
			  "value": "@endsWith(item().name, '.csv')",  // Adjust the condition based on your wildcard pattern
			  "type": "Expression"
			}
		  }
		},
		{
		  "name": "ProcessFilteredFiles",
		  "type": "ForEach",
		  "dependsOn": [
			"FilterFiles"
		  ],
		  "activities": [
			{
			  // Add activities to process or copy each filtered file
			}
		  ],
		  "linkedServiceName": {
			// Linked service details for your storage account
		  },
		  "typeProperties": {
			"items": {
			  "value": "@activity('FilterFiles').output",
			  "type": "Expression"
			}
		  }
		}
	  ]
	}
	In this example, the condition in the FilterFiles activity uses the endsWith function to filter 
	files based on a wildcard pattern (e.g., files ending with '.csv'). Adjust the condition according 
	to your specific wildcard pattern.

	Remember to replace placeholders with actual linked service and dataset details based on your 
	storage account and source folder configuration. Additionally, check the official Azure Data Factory 
	documentation for any updates or changes to wildcard functionality.


22. compare and copy missing files from source to destination use of get meta data filter for each and copy activity adf

2 / 2


ChatGPT
To compare and copy missing files from a source to a destination in Azure Data Factory (ADF), you can use the Get Metadata activity along with the Filter activity and the Copy Data activity. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

Get Metadata Activity: Use the Get Metadata activity to retrieve the list of files from both the source and destination locations.

Filter Activity: Apply filters to both the source and destination file lists to identify missing files. You can use the Filter activity to compare the metadata of files in both locations and filter out the files that exist in the source but not in the destination.

Copy Data Activity: Use the Copy Data activity to copy the missing files from the source to the destination. You can configure this activity to use the filtered list of files obtained from the previous step as the source dataset and the destination dataset.

Here's a general outline of the steps:

Create datasets for both the source and destination locations.

Create a pipeline with the following activities:

a. Get Metadata activity to retrieve the list of files from both the source and destination locations.

b. Filter activity to compare the lists of files and filter out the missing files.

c. Copy Data activity to copy the missing files from the source to the destination.

Configure the activities as follows:

a. In the Get Metadata activity, specify the source and destination datasets.

b. Use the Filter activity to compare the metadata of files in both locations and filter out the missing files.

c. Configure the Copy Data activity to use the filtered list of missing files as the source dataset and the destination dataset.

Run the pipeline to execute the activities and copy the missing files from the source to the destination.

Here's a basic example of how the pipeline activities might look in JSON format:

                        "type": "BlobSink"
                    },
                    "enableStaging": false,
                    "translator": {
                        "type": "TabularTranslator",
                        "columnMappings": {}
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
Replace placeholders such as SourceLinkedService, DestinationLinkedService, SourceDataset, 
and DestinationDataset with your actual dataset and linked service names.

This pipeline will compare the files in the source and destination locations, 
filter out the missing files, and then copy those missing files from the source to the destination.


23. How to Convert XML to Csv using Data Flow ADF | Flatten or Normalize Xml Source

	ChatGPT
	To convert XML to CSV using Azure Data Factory (ADF) Data Flows, you can use the Flatten or Normalize transformation to process the XML source data. Here's a step-by-step guide:

	Create Linked Services:
	Ensure you have linked services set up for your source and destination data stores. This could be Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, or any other supported data store.

	Create Datasets:
	Create datasets for your XML source data and CSV destination data. Configure these datasets to point to the respective locations in your data stores.

	Create a Data Flow:
	Create a Data Flow in your ADF pipeline. Add the XML source dataset to the data flow canvas.

	Flatten or Normalize XML Source:
	Depending on the structure of your XML data, choose either the Flatten or Normalize transformation to process the XML source.

	Flatten: Use this transformation if your XML data has nested elements that you want to flatten into a single level.

	Normalize: Use this transformation if your XML data has repeating elements or arrays that you want to normalize into separate rows.

	Configure Schema Mapping:
	Configure the schema mapping for the Flatten or Normalize transformation to map XML elements to columns in your data flow.

	Sink Data to CSV:
	Add a sink transformation to your data flow and configure it to write data to your CSV destination dataset.

	Configure Sink Mapping:
	Map the columns from your data flow to the columns in your CSV destination dataset.

	Run the Data Flow:
	Test your data flow by running it in debug mode. Verify that the XML data is correctly processed and written to the CSV destination.

	Here's an example of what the Data Flow might look like in ADF:

	json
	Copy code
	{
		"name": "XMLtoCSVDataFlow",
		"properties": {
			"type": "MappingDataFlow",
			"activities": [
				{
					"name": "XMLSource",
					"type": "Source",
					"outputs": [
						{
							"name": "XMLSourceOutput"
						}
					],
					"dataSource": {
						"referenceName": "<XMLSourceDataset>",
						"type": "DatasetReference"
					}
				},
				{
					"name": "FlattenXML",
					"type": "Flatten",
					"inputs": [
						{
							"referenceName": "XMLSourceOutput"
						}
					],
					"outputs": [
						{
							"name": "FlattenXMLOutput"
						}
					]
				},
				{
					"name": "CSVSink",
					"type": "Sink",
					"inputs": [
						{
							"referenceName": "FlattenXMLOutput"
						}
					],
					"dataSource": {
						"referenceName": "<CSVDestinationDataset>",
						"type": "DatasetReference"
					},
					"sink": {
						"type": "DelimitedTextSink"
					}
				}
			]
		}
	}
	Replace <XMLSourceDataset> and <CSVDestinationDataset> with the names of your XML source dataset and CSV destination dataset, respectively.

	This Data Flow will read XML data from the source dataset, flatten it using the Flatten transformation, and write the flattened data to the CSV destination dataset. Adjust the 
	configuration and schema mapping according to your specific XML structure and CSV requirements.


24. How to Use Execute Pipeline Activity in ADF and Synapse | Scenario Demo with Web,Copy,Fail Activity

	ChatGPT
	To demonstrate the use of the Execute Pipeline activity in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Synapse Analytics, along with other activities such as Web, Copy, and Fail, let's create a scenario where we have a parent pipeline that orchestrates the execution of child pipelines and performs various tasks like calling a REST API (Web activity), copying data between data stores (Copy activity), and handling errors (Fail activity).

	Here's a step-by-step guide to creating such a scenario:

	Create Child Pipelines:
	Create one or more child pipelines that perform specific tasks. For example, you might have a child pipeline for extracting data from a source, another for transforming data, and a third for loading data into a destination.

	Create Parent Pipeline:
	Create a parent pipeline that orchestrates the execution of the child pipelines. This parent pipeline will contain Execute Pipeline activities to invoke the child pipelines, along with other activities as needed.

	Configure Execute Pipeline Activity:
	Add Execute Pipeline activities to the parent pipeline to call the child pipelines. Configure each Execute Pipeline activity to specify the child pipeline to be executed.

	Add Additional Activities:
	Add other activities such as Web, Copy, and Fail to the parent pipeline as needed. For example, you might use a Web activity to call a REST API for authentication, a Copy activity to move data between Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Database, and a Fail activity to handle errors gracefully.

	Configure Dependencies and Error Handling:
	Configure dependencies between activities to ensure that they run in the desired order. Also, configure error handling mechanisms such as setting retry policies and error handling behaviors for each activity.

	Test and Debug:
	Test the parent pipeline by running it in debug mode. Monitor the execution and verify that each activity performs its task as expected. Debug any issues that arise during testing.

	Publish and Deploy:
	Once testing is complete, publish the changes to the Data Factory or Synapse workspace and deploy the pipeline to the production environment.

	Monitor and Maintain:
	Monitor the execution of the pipeline in the Azure portal to ensure that it runs smoothly. Make any necessary adjustments or optimizations to improve performance and reliability.

	Here's a simplified example of what the parent pipeline might look like in JSON format:

	json
	Copy code
	{
		"name": "ParentPipeline",
		"properties": {
			"activities": [
				{
					"name": "CallChildPipeline1",
					"type": "ExecutePipeline",
					"typeProperties": {
						"pipeline": {
							"referenceName": "ChildPipeline1",
							"type": "PipelineReference"
						}
					}
				},
				{
					"name": "CallChildPipeline2",
					"type": "ExecutePipeline",
					"typeProperties": {
						"pipeline": {
							"referenceName": "ChildPipeline2",
							"type": "PipelineReference"
						}
					}
				},
				{
					"name": "WebActivity",
					"type": "WebActivity",
					"typeProperties": {
						"url": "https://example.com/api",
						"method": "GET"
					}
				},
				{
					"name": "CopyActivity",
					"type": "Copy",
					"typeProperties": {
						"source": {
							"type": "BlobSource"
						},
						"sink": {
							"type": "SqlSink"
						}
					}
				},
				{
					"name": "FailActivity",
					"type": "Fail",
					"typeProperties": {
						"message": "Pipeline failed due to an error."
					}
				}
			]
		}
	}
	This example includes Execute Pipeline activities to call child pipelines named "ChildPipeline1" and "ChildPipeline2", as well as Web, Copy, and Fail activities to perform other 
	tasks. Adjust the configuration and activities according to your specific requirements.

Azure Data Factory Interview Questions for Beginners
Azure Data Factory Interview Questions for Beginners

Below are the commonly asked interview questions for beginners on Azure Data Factory to help you ace your interview and showcase your skills and knowledge: 

1. What is Azure Data Factory?
Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based, fully managed, serverless ETL and data integration service offered by Microsoft Azure for automating data movement from its native place to, say, a data lake or data warehouse using ETL (extract-transform-load) OR extract-load-transform (ELT). It lets you create and run data pipelines to help move and transform data and run scheduled pipelines. 

2. Is Azure Data Factory ETL or ELT tool?
It is a cloud-based Microsoft tool that provides a cloud-based integration service for data analytics at scale and supports ETL and ELT paradigms. 

3. Why is ADF needed?
With an increasing amount of big data, there is a need for a service like ADF that can orchestrate and operationalize processes to refine the enormous stores of raw business data into actionable business insights. 

4. What sets Azure Data Factory apart from conventional ETL tools?
Azure Data Factory stands out from other ETL tools as it provides: -

Enterprise Readiness: Data integration at Cloud Scale for big data analytics!

Enterprise Data Readiness: There are 90+ connectors supported to get your data from any disparate sources to the Azure cloud!

Code-Free Transformation: UI-driven mapping dataflows.

Ability to run Code on Any Azure Compute: Hands-on data transformations

Ability to rehost on-prem services on Azure Cloud in 3 Steps: Many SSIS packages run on Azure cloud.

Making DataOps seamless: with Source control, automated deploy & simple templates.

Secure Data Integration: Managed virtual networks protect against data exfiltration, which, in turn, simplifies your networking.

5. What are the major components of a Data Factory?
To work with Data Factory effectively, one must be aware of below concepts/components associated with it: -

Pipelines: Data Factory can contain one or more pipelines, which is a logical grouping of tasks/activities to perform a task. An activity can read data from Azure blob storage and load it into Cosmos DB or Synapse DB for analytics while transforming the data according to business logic. This way, one can work with a set of activities using one entity rather than dealing with several tasks individually.

Activities: Activities represent a processing step in a pipeline. For example, you might use a copy activity to copy data between data stores. Data Factory supports data movement, transformations, and control activities. 

Datasets: Datasets represent data structures within the data stores, which simply point to or reference the data you want to use in your activities as inputs or outputs.

Linked Service: This is more like a connection string, which will hold the information that Data Factory can connect to various sources. In the case of reading from Azure Blob storage, the storage-linked service will specify the connection string to connect to the blob, and the Azure blob dataset will select the container and folder containing the data.

Integration Runtime:  Integration runtime instances bridged the activity and linked Service. The linked Service or activity references it and provides the computing environment where the activity runs or gets dispatched. This way, the activity can be performed in the region closest to the target data stores or compute Services in the most performant way while meeting security (no publicly exposing data) and compliance needs.

Data Flows: These are objects you build visually in Data Factory, which transform data at scale on backend Spark services. You do not need to understand programming or Spark internals. Design your data transformation intent using graphs (Mapping) or spreadsheets (Power query activity).  

Refer to the documentation for more details: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/frequently-asked-questions

The below snapshot explains the relationship between pipeline, activity, dataset, and linked service.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/media/introduction/data-factory-visual-guide.png

Overview of Azure Data Factory Architecture

6. What are the different ways to execute pipelines in Azure Data Factory?
There are three ways in which we can execute a pipeline in Data Factory:

Debug mode can be helpful when trying out pipeline code and acts as a tool to test and troubleshoot our code.

Manual Execution is what we do by clicking on the ‘Trigger now’ option in a pipeline. This is useful if you want to run your pipelines on an ad-hoc basis.

We can schedule our pipelines at predefined times and intervals via a Trigger. As we will see later in this article, there are three types of triggers available in Data Factory. 

7. What is the purpose of Linked services in Azure Data Factory?
Linked services are used majorly for two purposes in Data Factory:

For a Data Store representation, i.e., any storage system like Azure Blob storage account, a file share, or an Oracle DB/ SQL Server instance.

 For Compute representation, i.e., the underlying VM will execute the activity defined in the pipeline. 

8. Can you Elaborate more on Data Factory Integration Runtime?
The Integration Runtime, or IR, is the compute infrastructure for Azure Data Factory pipelines. It is the bridge between activities and linked services. The linked Service or Activity references it and provides the computing environment where the activity is run directly or dispatched. This allows the activity to be performed in the closest region to the target data stores or computing Services.

The following diagram shows the location settings for Data Factory and its integration runtimes:

Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime

Source: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-integration-runtime  

Azure Data Factory supports three types of integration runtime, and one should choose based on their data integration capabilities and network environment requirements.

Azure Integration Runtime: To copy data between cloud data stores and send activity to various computing services such as SQL Server, Azure HDInsight, etc.

Self-Hosted Integration Runtime: Used for running copy activity between cloud data stores and data stores in private networks. Self-hosted integration runtime is software with the same code as the Azure Integration Runtime but installed on your local system or machine over a virtual network. 

Azure SSIS Integration Runtime: You can run SSIS packages in a managed environment. So, when we lift and shift SSIS packages to the data factory, we use Azure SSIS Integration Runtime. 

9. What is required to execute an SSIS package in Data Factory?
We must create an SSIS integration runtime and an SSISDB catalog hosted in the Azure SQL server database or Azure SQL-managed instance before executing an SSIS package.

10. What is the limit on the number of Integration Runtimes, if any?
Within a Data Factory, the default limit on any entities is set to 5000, including pipelines, data sets, triggers, linked services, Private Endpoints, and integration runtimes. If required, one can create an online support ticket to raise the limit to a higher number.

Refer to the documentation for more details: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-data-factory-limits. 

11.  What are ARM Templates in Azure Data Factory? What are they used for?
An ARM template is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for the data factory pipeline, including pipeline activities, linked services, datasets, etc. The template will contain essentially the same code as our pipeline.

ARM templates are helpful when we want to migrate our pipeline code to higher environments, say Production or Staging from Development, after we are convinced that the code is working correctly.

Kickstart your data engineer career with end-to-end solved big data projects for beginners.

12.  How can we deploy code to higher environments in Data Factory?
At a very high level, we can achieve this with the below set of steps:

Create a feature branch that will store our code base.

Create a pull request to merge the code after we’re sure to the Dev branch.

Publish the code from the dev to generate ARM templates.

This can trigger an automated CI/CD DevOps pipeline to promote code to higher environments like Staging or Production.

13.  Which three activities can you run in Microsoft Azure Data Factory?
Azure Data Factory supports three activities: data movement, transformation, and control activities.

Data movement activities: As the name suggests, these activities help move data from one place to another.
e.g., Copy Activity in Data Factory copies data from a source to a sink data store.

Data transformation activities: These activities help transform the data while we load it into the data's target or destination.
e.g., Stored Procedure, U-SQL, Azure Functions, etc.

Control flow activities: Control (flow) activities help control the flow of any activity in a pipeline. 

e.g., wait activity makes the pipeline wait for a specified time. 

14.  What are the two types of compute environments supported by Data Factory to execute the transform activities?
Below are the types of computing environments that Data Factory supports for executing transformation activities: -

i) On-Demand Computing Environment: This is a fully managed environment provided by ADF. This type of calculation creates a cluster to perform the transformation activity and automatically deletes it when the activity is complete.

ii) Bring Your Environment: In this environment, you can use ADF to manage your computing environment if you already have the infrastructure for on-premises services. 

15.  What are the steps involved in an ETL process?
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process follows four main steps:

i) Connect and Collect: Connect to the data source/s and move data to local and crowdsource data storage.

ii) Data transformation using computing services such as HDInsight, Hadoop, Spark, etc.

iii) Publish: To load data into Azure data lake storage, Azure SQL data warehouse, Azure SQL databases, Azure Cosmos DB, etc.

iv)Monitor: Azure Data Factory has built-in support for pipeline monitoring via Azure Monitor, API, PowerShell, Azure Monitor logs, and health panels on the Azure portal.

16.  If you want to use the output by executing a query, which activity shall you use? 
Look-up activity can return the result of executing a query or stored procedure.

The output can be a singleton value or an array of attributes, which can be consumed in subsequent copy data activity, or any transformation or control flow activity like ForEach activity.

17.  Can we pass parameters to a pipeline run? 
Yes, parameters are a first-class, top-level concept in Data Factory. We can define parameters at the pipeline level and pass arguments as you execute the pipeline run on demand or using a trigger. 

18.  Have you used Execute Notebook activity in Data Factory? How to pass parameters to a notebook activity?
We can execute notebook activity to pass code to our databricks cluster. We can pass parameters to a notebook activity using the baseParameters property. If the parameters are not defined/ specified in the activity, default values from the notebook are executed.          

19.  What are some useful constructs available in Data Factory?
parameter: Each activity within the pipeline can consume the parameter value           passed to the pipeline and run with the @parameter construct.

coalesce: We can use the @coalesce construct in the expressions to handle null values gracefully.

activity: An activity output can be consumed in a subsequent activity with the            @activity construct. 

20.  Can we push code and have CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) in ADF?
Data Factory fully supports CI/CD of your data pipelines using Azure DevOps and GitHub. This allows you to develop and deliver your ETL processes incrementally before publishing the finished product. After the raw data has been refined into a business-ready consumable form, load the data into Azure Data Warehouse or Azure SQL Azure Data Lake, Azure Cosmos DB, or whichever analytics engine your business uses can point to from their business intelligence tools.

21.  What do you mean by variables in the Azure Data Factory?
Variables in the Azure Data Factory pipeline provide the functionality to hold the values. They are used for a similar reason as we use variables in any programming language and are available inside the pipeline.

Set variables and append variables are two activities used for setting or manipulating the values of the variables. There are two types of variables in a data factory: -

i) System variables:  These are fixed variables from the Azure pipeline. For example, pipeline name, pipeline id, trigger name, etc. You need these to get the system information required in your use case.

ii) User variable: A user variable is declared manually in your code based on your pipeline logic.

22.  What are mapping data flows?
Mapping data flows are visually designed data transformations in Azure Data Factory. Data flows allow data engineers to develop a graphical data transformation logic without writing code. The resulting data flows are executed as activities within Azure Data Factory pipelines that use scaled-out Apache Spark clusters. Data flow activities can be operationalized using Azure Data Factory scheduling, control flow, and monitoring capabilities.

Mapping data flows provides an entirely visual experience with no coding required. Data flows run on ADF-managed execution clusters for scaled-out data processing. Azure Data Factory manages all the code translation, path optimization, and execution of the data flow jobs.

23.  What is copy activity in the Azure Data Factory?
Copy activity is one of the most popular and universally used activities in the Azure data factory. It is used for ETL or Lift and Shift, where you want to move the data from one data source to another. While you copy the data, you can also do the transformation; for example, you read the data from the TXT/CSV file, which contains 12 columns; however, while writing to your target data source, you want to keep only seven columns. You can transform it and send only the required columns to the destination data source.

24.  Can you elaborate more on the Copy activity?
The copy activity performs the following steps at high-level:

i) Read data from the source data store. (e.g., blob storage)

ii) Perform the following tasks on the data:

Serialization/deserialization

Compression/decompression

Column mapping

iii) Write data to the destination data store or sink. (e.g., azure data lake)

This is summarized in the below graphic:

Azure Data Factory Interview Questions for Experienced Professionals 
Azure Data Factory Interview Questions for Experienced Professionals

Experienced professionals must understand its capabilities and features with the growing demand for ADF. Check out some of the most commonly asked Azure Data Factory interview questions for experienced professionals based on years of experience, providing insights into what employers are looking for and what you can expect in your next job interview.

ADF Interview Questions For 3 Years Experience
Below are the most likely asked interview questions on Azure Data Factory for 3 years of experience professionals: 

25.  What are the different activities you have used in Azure Data Factory?
Here you can share some of the significant activities if you have used them in your career, whether your work or college project. Here are a few of the most used activities :

Copy Data Activity to copy the data between datasets.

ForEach Activity for looping.

Get Metadata Activity that can provide metadata about any data source.

Set Variable Activity to define and initiate variables within pipelines.

Lookup Activity to do a lookup to get some values from a table/file.

Wait Activity to wait for a specified amount of time before/in between the pipeline run.

Validation Activity will validate the presence of files within the dataset.

Web Activity to call a custom REST endpoint from an ADF pipeline.

26.  How can I schedule a pipeline?
You can use the time window or scheduler trigger to schedule a pipeline. The trigger uses a wall-clock calendar schedule, which can schedule pipelines periodically or in calendar-based recurrent patterns (for example, on Mondays at 6:00 PM and Thursdays at 9:00 PM).

 Currently, the service supports three types of triggers:

Tumbling window trigger: A trigger that operates on a periodic interval while retaining a state.

Schedule Trigger: A trigger that invokes a pipeline on a wall-clock schedule.

Event-Based Trigger: A trigger that responds to an event. e.g., a file getting placed inside a blob.
Pipelines and triggers have a many-to-many relationship (except for the tumbling window trigger). Multiple triggers can kick off a single pipeline, or a single trigger can kick off numerous pipelines.

27.   When should you choose Azure Data Factory?
One should consider using Data Factory-

When working with big data, there is a need for a data warehouse to be implemented; you might require a cloud-based integration solution like ADF for the same.

Not all team members are experienced in coding and may prefer graphical tools to work with data.

When raw business data is stored at diverse data sources, which can be on-prem and on the cloud, we would like to have one analytics solution like ADF to integrate them all in one place.

We would like to use readily available data movement and processing solutions and be light regarding infrastructure management. So, a managed solution like ADF makes more sense in this case.

 28.  How can you access data using the other 90 dataset types in Data Factory?
The mapping data flow feature allows Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics, delimited text files from Azure storage account or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and Parquet files from blob storage or Data Lake Storage Gen2 natively for source and sink data source.

Use the Copy activity to stage data from any other connectors and then execute a Data Flow activity to transform data after it's been staged.

29.  What is the difference between mapping and wrangling data flow (Power query activity)? 
Mapping data flows transform data at scale without requiring coding. You can design a data transformation job in the data flow canvas by constructing a series of transformations. Start with any number of source transformations followed by data transformation steps. Complete your data flow with a sink to land your results in a destination. It is excellent at mapping and transforming data with known and unknown schemas in the sinks and sources.

Power Query Data Wrangling allows you to do agile data preparation and exploration using the Power Query Online mashup editor at scale via spark execution.

It supports 24 SQL data types from char, nchar to int, bigint and timestamp, xml, etc.

Refer to the documentation here for more details: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/frequently-asked-questions#supported-sql-types

Azure Data Factory Interview Questions For 4 Years Experience
If you’re a professional with 4 years of experience in Azure Data Factory, check out the list of these common ADF interview questions that you may encounter during your job interview.

30.   Can a value be calculated for a new column from the existing column from mapping in ADF?
We can derive transformations in the mapping data flow to generate a new column based on our desired logic. We can create a new derived column or update an existing one when developing a derived one. Enter the name of the column you're making in the Column textbox.

You can use the column dropdown to override an existing column in your schema. Click the Enter expression textbox to start creating the derived column’s expression. You can input or use the expression builder to build your logic.

31.  How is the lookup activity useful in the Azure Data Factory?
In the ADF pipeline, the Lookup activity is commonly used for configuration lookup purposes, and the source dataset is available. Moreover, it retrieves the data from the source dataset and then sends it as the activity output. Generally, the output of the lookup activity is further used in the pipeline for making decisions or presenting any configuration as a result.

Simply put, lookup activity is used for data fetching in the ADF pipeline. The way you would use it entirely relies on your pipeline logic. Obtaining only the first row is possible, or you can retrieve the complete rows depending on your dataset or query.

32.  Elaborate more on the Get Metadata activity in Azure Data Factory.
The Get Metadata activity is used to retrieve the metadata of any data in the Azure Data Factory or a Synapse pipeline. We can use the output from the Get Metadata activity in conditional expressions to perform validation or consume the metadata in subsequent activities.

It takes a dataset as input and returns metadata information as output. Currently, the following connectors and the corresponding retrievable metadata are supported. The maximum size of returned metadata is 4 MB. 

Please refer to the snapshot below for supported metadata which can be retrieved using the Get Metadata activity.

33.  How to debug an ADF pipeline?
Debugging is one of the crucial aspects of any coding-related activity needed to test the code for any issues it might have. It also provides an option to debug the pipeline without executing it. 

Azure Data Factory Interview Questions For 5 Years Experience
Here are some of the most likely asked Azure Data Factory interview questions for professionals with 5 years of experience to help you prepare for your next job interview and feel confident in showcasing your expertise.

34.  What does it mean by the breakpoint in the ADF pipeline?
To understand better, for example, you are using three activities in the pipeline, and now you want to debug up to the second activity only. You can do this by placing the breakpoint at the second activity. To add a breakpoint, click the circle present at the top of the activity.

35.  What is the use of the ADF Service?
ADF primarily organizes the data copying between relational and non-relational data sources hosted locally in data centers or the cloud. Moreover, you can use ADF Service to transform the ingested data to fulfill business requirements. In most Big Data solutions, ADF Service is used as an ETL or ELT tool for data ingestion.

36.  Explain the data source in the Azure data factory.
The data source is the source or destination system that comprises the data intended to be utilized or executed. The data type can be binary, text, CSV, JSON, image files, video, audio, or a proper database.

Examples of data sources include Azure data lake storage, azure blob storage, or any other database such as MySQL DB, Azure SQL database, Postgres, etc.

37.  Can you share any difficulties you faced while getting data from on-premises to Azure cloud using Data Factory?
One of the significant challenges we face while migrating from on-prem to the cloud is throughput and speed. When we try to copy the data using Copy activity from on-prem, the process rate could be faster, and hence we need to get the desired throughput. 

There are some configuration options for a copy activity, which can help in tuning this process and can give desired results.

i) We should use the compression option to get the data in a compressed mode while loading from on-prem servers, which is then de-compressed while writing on the cloud storage.

ii) Staging area should be the first destination of our data after we have enabled the compression. The copy activity can decompress before writing it to the final cloud storage buckets.

iii) Degree of Copy Parallelism is another option to help improve the migration process. This is identical to having multiple threads processing data and can speed up the data copy process.

There is no right fit-for-all here, so we must try different numbers like 8, 16, or 32 to see which performs well.

iv) Data Integration Unit is loosely the number of CPUs used, and increasing it may improve the performance of the copy process. 

38.  How to copy multiple sheet data from an Excel file?
When using an Excel connector within a data factory, we must provide a sheet name from which we must load data. This approach is nuanced when we have to deal with a single or a handful of sheets of data, but when we have lots of sheets (say 10+), this may become a tedious task as we have to change the hard-coded sheet name every time!

However, we can use a data factory binary data format connector for this and point it to the Excel file and need not provide the sheet name/s. We’ll be able to use copy activity to copy the data from all the sheets present in the file.

39.  Is it possible to have nested looping in Azure Data Factory?
There is no direct support for nested looping in the data factory for any looping activity (for each / until). However, we can use one for each/until loop activity which will contain an execute pipeline activity that can have a loop activity. This way, when we call the looping activity, it will indirectly call another loop activity, and we'll be able to achieve nested looping.

Azure Data Factory Interview Questions for 6 Years Experience
Below are some of the most commonly asked Azure Data Factory advanced interview questions for professionals with 6 years of experience, helping to ensure that you are well-prepared for your next job interview.

40.  How to copy multiple tables from one datastore to another datastore?
An efficient approach to complete this task would be:

Maintain a lookup table/ file containing the list of tables and their source, which needs to be copied.

Then, we can use the lookup activity and each loop activity to scan through the list.

Inside the for each loop activity, we can use a copy activity or a mapping dataflow to copy multiple tables to the destination datastore.

41.  What are some performance-tuning techniques for Mapping Data Flow activity?
We could consider the below set of parameters for tuning the performance of a Mapping Data Flow activity we have in a pipeline.

i) We should leverage partitioning in the source, sink, or transformation whenever possible. Microsoft, however, recommends using the default partition (size 128 MB) selected by the Data Factory as it intelligently chooses one based on our pipeline configuration.

Still, one should try out different partitions and see if they can have improved performance.

ii) We should not use a data flow activity for each loop activity. Instead, we have multiple files similar in structure and processing needs. In that case, we should use a wildcard path inside the data flow activity, enabling the processing of all the files within a folder.

iii) The recommended file format to use is ‘. parquet’. The reason being the pipeline will execute by spinning up spark clusters, and Parquet is the native file format for Apache Spark; thus, it will generally give good performance.

iv) Multiple logging modes are available: Basic, Verbose, and None.

We should only use verbose mode if essential, as it will log all the details about each operation the activity performs. e.g., It will log all the details of the operations performed for all our partitions. This one is useful when troubleshooting issues with the data flow.

The basic mode will give out all the necessary basic details in the log, so try to use this one whenever possible.

v)  Try to break down a complex data flow activity into multiple data flow activities. Let’s say we have several transformations between source and sink, and by adding more, we think the design has become complex. In this case, try to have it in multiple such activities, which will give two advantages:

All activities will run on separate spark clusters, decreasing the run time for the whole task.

The whole pipeline will be easy to understand and maintain in the future. 

42.  What are some of the limitations of ADF?
Azure Data Factory provides great functionalities for data movement and transformations. However, there are some limitations as well.

i) We can’t have nested looping activities in the data factory, and we must use some workaround if we have that sort of structure in our pipeline. All the looping activities come under this: If, Foreach, switch, and until activities.

ii) The lookup activity can retrieve only 5000 rows at a time and not more than that. Again, we need to use some other loop activity along with SQL with the limit to achieve this sort of structure in the pipeline.

iii) We can have 40 activities in a single pipeline, including inner activity, containers, etc. To overcome this, we should modularize the pipelines regarding the number of datasets, activities, etc.

44. How are all the components of Azure Data Factory combined to complete an ADF task?

Azure Databricks is a popular platform for data engineering and data science, providing a powerful and flexible environment for processing and analyzing large data sets. As with any new technology, there are bound to be questions and challenges that arise as you work with it. In this article, we'll look at some of the most common Azure Databricks scenario-based questions and provide solutions to help you overcome them.
1. How do I connect to an Azure SQL Database from Databricks?
One of the most common scenarios when working with Azure Databricks is connecting to an Azure SQL Database. To do this, you'll need to first create a JDBC connection string that points to your Azure SQL Database. You can do this by going to the Azure portal and navigating to the SQL Database that you want to connect to. From there, click on the "Connection strings" tab and copy the JDBC connection string.
Once you have the JDBC connection string, you can use it to connect to your Azure SQL Database from Databricks. You can do this by creating a new notebook and running the following code:
val jdbcUrl = "jdbc:sqlserver://<server>.database.windows.net:1433;database=<database>;user=<username>@<server>;password=<password>;encrypt=true;trustServerCertificate=false;hostNameInCertificate=*.database.windows.net;loginTimeout=30;
val connectionProperties = new java.util.Properties()
connectionProperties.put("user", "username")
connectionProperties.put("password", "password")
val df = spark.read.jdbc(jdbcUrl, "tableName", connectionProperties)
2. How do I read and write data to/from Azure Blob Storage?
Another common scenario when working with Azure Databricks is reading and writing data to/from Azure Blob Storage. To do this, you'll need to first create an Azure Blob Storage account and a container in that account. Once you have done that, you can use the following code to read and write data to/from Azure Blob Storage:
// To read data from Azure Blob Storage
val df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("wasbs://<container>@<storage_account>.blob.core.windows.net/<path>")

// To write data to Azure Blob Storage
df.write.format("csv").save("wasbs://<container>@<storage_account>.blob.core.windows.net/<path>")
3. How do I perform data transformation and cleansing in Databricks?
Data transformation and cleansing is a common task when working with data in Databricks. To perform these tasks, you can use the built-in Spark DataFrame API. For example, you can use the following code to filter data, select columns, and perform other data cleansing tasks:
val df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("path")


// Filter data
val filteredDF = df.filter("columnName > 100")


// Select columns
val selectedDF = df.select("column1", "column2")


// Perform data cleansing tasks
val cleanedDF = df.withColumn("columnName", lower(col("columnName")))
4. How do I train and deploy a machine learning model in Azure Databricks?
Training and deploying machine learning models in Azure Databricks is a powerful way to extract insights from your data. To train a model, you can use the built-in machine learning libraries in Databricks, such as MLlib or TensorFlow. For example, you can use the following code to train a linear regression model:
import org.apache.spark.ml.regression.LinearRegression


val data = spark.read.format("libsvm").load("data/mllib/sample_linear_regression_data.txt")
val lr = new LinearRegression().setMaxIter(10).setRegParam(0.3).setElasticNetParam(0.8)
val lrModel = lr.fit(data)
Once you have trained a model, you can deploy it to a production environment by saving it to a file and loading it into your application. For example, you can use the following code to save a model to a file:
lrModel.save("model.txt")
And then load it into your application:
val model = LinearRegressionModel.load("model.txt")
5. How do I schedule and automate jobs in Azure Databricks?
One of the powerful features of Azure Databricks is the ability to schedule and automate jobs. This allows you to automate repetitive tasks such as data processing, model training, and data export. To schedule and automate jobs, you can use the built-in job scheduler in Databricks.
To create a new job, go to the "Jobs" tab in the Databricks workspace and click on the "Create Job" button. From there, you can select the notebook that you want to run as a job, set the schedule, and configure any other job settings.
You can also use the Databricks REST API to schedule and automate jobs programmatically. This allows you to integrate Databricks jobs with other systems and tools, such as Azure Data Factory or Azure Logic Apps.
Another way to schedule and automate jobs in Azure Databricks is by using Azure Data Factory. You can use ADF to schedule and execute notebooks, jars and scripts in Databricks.
6. How do I troubleshoot and optimize performance in Azure Databricks?
As with any data processing platform, performance and troubleshooting can be a challenge in Azure Databricks. However, there are a few things that you can do to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues.
First, make sure that your cluster is configured with the correct number of nodes and the correct amount of memory and CPU. This can have a big impact on performance, especially when working with large data sets.
Next, use the built-in performance monitoring tools in Databricks to track resource usage and identify bottlenecks. For example, you can use the "Task Metrics" tab in the Databricks workspace to view CPU and memory usage for each task.
You can also use the Spark UI to view the progress of jobs and the stage details, this can help you identify slow stages and understand the cause of slow performance.
Finally, consider using the Databricks Optimize feature to automatically optimize your Spark SQL queries for better performance. This feature uses machine learning algorithms to analyze query patterns and optimize them for better performance.
7. How do I secure my data and access to Databricks?
Security is a crucial aspect of working with data in Azure Databricks. To ensure that your data is secure, you can use a number of built-in security features.

15 Azure Databricks Interview Questions and Answers for Data Engineers
Here are the top 15 Azure interview questions and answers you must prepare for your big data engineer interview.

PySpark Databricks Interview Questions
Below are some popular interview questions on PySpark Databricks - 

1. How does PySpark DataFrames work?
The distributed collection of structured data is called a PySpark DataFrame. They are stored in named columns and are equivalent to relational database tables. Additionally, PySpark DataFrames are more effectively optimized than Python or R code. Various sources, including Structured Data Files, Hive Tables, external databases, existing RDDs, etc., can be used to create them.

2. Define PySpark Partition. What's the maximum number of partitions PySpark allows?
The PySpark Partition method divides a large dataset into smaller datasets using one or more partition keys. When transformations on partitioned data run more quickly, execution performance is improved. This is due to the concurrent operation of each partition's transformations. PySpark supports two partitioning methods: partitioning in memory (DataFrame) and partitioning on a disc (File system). partitionBy (self, *cols) is the syntax for it. Adding 4x as many partitions are accessible to the cluster application core count is advisable.

3. How does PySpark rename a DataFrame column?
Renaming a DataFrame column is possible using PySpark's withColumnRenamed() method. You often need to keep PySpark DataFrame in single or multiple columns. There are various methods for doing it. With withColumnRenamed, you cannot edit or rename a column since DataFrame is an immutable collection (). This is because it creates a new DataFrame with the revised column names. Renaming all columns or choosing multiple columns are two widely used methods to rename nested columns.

Databricks Delta Lake Interview Questions 
The following questions focus mainly on the Databricks Delta Lake service.

4. How do you import data into Delta Lake?
Loading data into Delta Lake is quite simple. Using Databricks Auto Loader or the COPY INTO command with SQL, you can automatically intake new data files into Delta Lake as they arrive in your data lake (for example, on S3 or ADLS). Additionally, you can batch-read your data using Apache SparkTM, make any necessary changes, and then store the outcome in Delta Lake format.

5. Does Delta Lake offer access controls for security and governance?
You can leverage access control lists (ACLs) to set permissions for workspace objects (folders, notebooks, experiments, and models), clusters, pools, tasks, data schemas, tables, views, etc., using Delta Lake on Databricks. Both administrators and users with delegated access control list management rights have this access.

6. What does an index mean in the context of Delta Lake?
An index is a data structure that supports Delta Lake in improving query performance by enabling fast data lookups. It is possible to speed up queries that filter on a particular column or columns by using an index on a Delta table.

Databricks Python Interview Questions
The following questions mainly explore the integration of Databricks and Python.

7. Is PySpark DataFrames' implementation entirely different from other Python DataFrames like Pandas, or are there some similarities?
While Pandas are the source of inspiration for Spark DataFrames and behave similarly, they are not the same. You should use DataFrames in Spark rather than Pandas. To lessen the performance impact of switching between the two frameworks, users of Pandas and Spark DataFrames should consider implementing Apache Arrow.

8. Is it possible to utilize multiple languages in one notebook, or are there substantial restrictions? Is it usable in later stages if you build a DataFrame in your Python notebook using a % Scala magic?
A Scala DataFrame can be produced and then used as a Python reference. Write your program in Scala or Python if possible. 

9. Which programming languages can be used to integrate with Azure Databricks?
Python, Scala, and R are a few examples of languages that you can use with the Apache Spark framework. Azure Databricks also supports SQL as a database language.

Databricks Interview Questions Scenario-Based
Below are some popular scenario-based Databricks interview questions.

10. Suppose you have just begun your job at XYZ Company. Your manager has instructed you to develop business analytics logic in the Azure notebook leveraging some of the general functionality code written by other team members. How would you proceed?
You must import the databricks code into your notebook to reuse it. There are two additional options to import the code. If the code is present in the same workspace, you can import it immediately. If the code is outside the workspace, you should build a jar or module out of it and import it into the databricks cluster.

11. How do you handle the Databricks code while using TFS or Git in a collaborative environment?
The initial problem is the lack of support for Team Foundation Server (TFS). You can only use Git or a repository system built on the distributed format of Git. While it would be ideal to link Databricks to your Git directory of notebooks, you can still consider Databricks as a replica of your project, even though this is not presently feasible. Your first step is to start a notebook, which you then update before submitting to version control.

12. How can a SQL query be executed in a Python or Scala notebook without Spark SQL?
If you type "%sql" at the beginning of any block in the Databricks notebook, the block will be converted from a Python/Scala notebook to a Simple SQL Notebook.

Azure Databricks Interview Questions and Answers For Experienced
Here are a few Azure Databricks interview questions for experienced data engineers.

13. What is the method for creating a Databricks private access token?
Go to the "user profile" icon and choose "User setting" to create a private access token. You must choose the "Access Tokens" tab to access the "Generate New Token" button. To create the token, press the right button.

14. Define a Databricks secret.
A secret is a key-value pair that can be used to safeguard confidential data. it consists of a special key name enclosed in a secure environment. There are only 1000 secrets allowed per scope. There is a 128 KB maximum size limit.

15. What possible challenges might you come across using Azure Databricks?
If you don't have enough credits to construct more clusters, you might experience cluster creation failures. If your code is incompatible with the Databricks runtime, Spark errors will occur. Network issues may occur if your network is not set up correctly or if you try to access Databricks from an unsupported location.
