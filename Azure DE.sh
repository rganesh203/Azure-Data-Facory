17. #Question : What is integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory and What are type of them?
	Answer: The Integration Runtime (IR) is the compute infrastructure used by Azure Data Factory
	Types:

	Azure IR
	Azure integration runtime provides a fully managed, serverless compute in Azure. You donot have to 
	worry about infrastructure provision, software installation, patching, or capacity scaling. In 
	addition, you only pay for the duration of the actual utilization.

	Self-hosted IR
	If you want to perform data integration securely in a private network environment that doesnot have 
	a direct line-of-sight from the public cloud environment, you can install a self-hosted IR in your 
	on-premises	environment behind a firewall, or inside a virtual private network. The self-hosted 
	integration runtime only makes outbound HTTP-based connections to the internet.

	Azure-SSIS IR
	The Azure-SSIS IR is a fully managed cluster of Azure VMS dedicated to run your SSIS packages. 
	You can bring your own Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance for the catalog of SSIS 
	projects/packages (SSISDB).	You can scale up the power of the compute by specifying node size 
	and scale it out by specifying the number of nodes in the cluster. You can manage the cost of 
	running your Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime by stopping	and starting it as your requirements demand.

19. #data lakehouse vs warehouse vs data lake
	
	Data Lakehouse, Data Warehouse, and Data Lake are all terms related to data storage and management 
	architectures, each serving different purposes. Let us explain each concept:

	Data Lake: A Data Lake is a large and flexible repository that stores raw and unstructured data 
	from various sources. It allows organizations to store massive amounts of data in its native format 
	without requiring a predefined schema. Data Lakes are typically built on distributed file systems 
	like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or cloud-based object storage like Azure Data Lake 
	Storage (ADLS) or Amazon S3. Data Lakes are suitable for storing big data and semi-
	structured/unstructured data, making it easier to perform exploratory data analysis and data 
	discovery.

	Data Warehouse: A Data Warehouse is a structured and centralized repository that stores data 
	from various sources after transforming, cleaning, and integrating it into a consistent format. 
	The data is organized in a schema, usually a star or snowflake schema, optimized for analytical 
	queries and reporting. Data Warehouses are designed for business intelligence, data analytics, 
	and data mining purposes. Traditional Data Warehouses are often implemented using relational 
	database systems like SQL Server, Oracle, or Snowflake.

	Data Lakehouse: The Data Lakehouse is a relatively newer concept that combines the features of 
	both Data Lake and Data Warehouse. It aims to bring the benefits of a Data Lake (storing raw and 
	unstructured data) and a Data Warehouse (structured and optimized for analytical processing) into a 
	single architecture. Data Lakehouse leverages technologies like Delta Lake (open-source storage 
	layer on top of a Data Lake) or similar solutions to add ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, 
	Durability) transactions, schema enforcement, and indexing capabilities to the raw data stored in 
	the Data Lake. This combination allows users to perform both batch and real-time data processing, 
	along with enabling traditional BI and analytics workloads, all from the same data repository.

	In summary:

	Data Lake: Stores raw and unstructured data at scale, ideal for big data and exploratory data 
	analysis.
	Data Warehouse: Centralized repository with structured data, optimized for business intelligence 
	and analytical queries.
	Data Lakehouse: A hybrid architecture that combines the benefits of both Data Lake and Data Warehouse, 
	offering flexibility and analytical capabilities.
	The choice between these architectures depends on the specific requirements of your organization, the 
	nature of the data you are dealing with, and the type of data processing and analysis you intend to perform.

	delta lake vs data lake

	Delta Lake and Data Lake are related concepts, but they serve different purposes in the context of 
	data storage and management. Let us compare them:

	Data Lake:

	A Data Lake is a vast repository that stores raw and unstructured data from various sources, such 
	as log files, IoT devices, social media, etc.
	It is designed to accommodate large volumes of data in its native format without the need for a 
	predefined schema, allowing data to be ingested without immediate transformation.
	Data Lakes are typically built on distributed file systems like Hadoop Distributed File System 
	(HDFS) or cloud-based object storage systems like Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).
	Data Lakes are suitable for big data and semi-structured/unstructured data storage, making it 
	easier to perform exploratory data analysis and data discovery.
	Delta Lake:

	Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that operates on top of a Data Lake, providing additional 
	functionality and capabilities.
	It adds ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions to the data stored in the 
	Data Lake, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
	Delta Lake introduces schema enforcement, meaning that data is organized in a structured format with 
	defined schemas, which brings some order to the otherwise schema-less Data Lake.
	It supports features like time travel, which allows you to access and query the history of the data, 
	making it easy to roll back to previous versions or analyze changes over time.
	Delta Lake also provides powerful performance optimizations, like indexing and data skipping, which 
	improve query speeds.
	
	Comparison:

	Data Lake is the underlying storage repository, while Delta Lake is a technology that enhances the 
	capabilities of a Data Lake. Data Lake stores raw and unstructured data, whereas Delta Lake adds 
	structure and reliability by incorporating ACID transactions and schema enforcement.
	Delta Lake improves data quality and enables more advanced analytics capabilities compared to a 
	traditional Data Lake, but it also comes with additional overhead and processing complexity.
	In summary, while Data Lake is the foundation for storing raw and unstructured data, Delta Lake is a 
	solution that can be layered on top of a Data Lake to provide data integrity, schema enforcement, and 
	advanced query performance, making it more suitable for building data pipelines and analytical 
	workloads.
